New: 
- import or export vault profile.

For repeat last command, it's there now https://github.com/1C0D/obsidian-repeat-last-commands (waiting to be released)

- Import/export  Vault Profile  
  yo can check what you want to import/export. mainly: themes, snippets, plugins[^0], prefs, hotkeys,...
  if existing json files and folder are updated. kind of sync...   


---
- Move/Copy File(s)/Dir(s) OUT of Vault[^1][^2]
  with options to replace or increment existing file(s)/dir(s)   
  and to copy resolved links too (md, jpg...) 
--- 
- Move/Copy File(s)/Dir(s) To Vault or folder (folder context menu)
---
- added search from directory improved (by Liam)
---
- each part of the plugin can be disabled in settings.

[^0] copying plugins won't copy node-modules folders, so cloned repo will be copied super fast. debugs are printed
[^1]: you can select several files holding alt  
[^2]: the destination folder is opened at the end to check results...
